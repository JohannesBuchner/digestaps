Digest authentication seems to work with squid-3.1.8. 
Doesn't seem to work well with squid 3.0.STABLE13.
More testing and beta-testers needed!


There is an issue with APS working as a standalone proxy. It serves requests from
an http-client one by one and allows persistent connections, then it may receive several
request in very sort time to one thread, and one of them may be to almost dead banner
site, then all the requests made after that one will be waiting till that "bad" connection
will be closed due to timeout. So I suggest switching off HTTP/1.1 presistent connections
in your browser when you are using APS for web (not proxy) authentication and surfing
banner rich evironment.
